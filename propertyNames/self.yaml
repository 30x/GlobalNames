description: > 
  self is the preferred property for expressing identity. Its value is an HTTP URL. In the representation of a resource, the self property
  contains the identity of the rersource whose property/value pairs appear in the same JSON object. Most resources contain information about themselves, so the value of self and the 
  URI of the resource are usually the same at the outer level of JSON.
  The self URL may be either absolute (begins with http:// or https://) or relative. If it's relative, it should be 'path-absolute' â€” that is, it should begin with a leading slash.
  Absolute URLs are preferred, but relative is OK. URLs that begin with a double slash are also OK (e.g. //apigee.com/foo). Clients should be able to handle any valid URL that is
  relative to the base implied by the representation the relative URL is found in.
