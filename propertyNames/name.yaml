  Name is one of the more subtle concepts. Names generally have the following properties:
  * They can be changed - they are not immutable
  * They are unique within some scope. For example, files within a folder, or departments within a company cannot have the same name
  * There are some restrictions on characters. Often, whitespace is forbidden

  If the property you are defining is immutable, you may want the identity (id) property or the self, not the name property.
  If the property you are defining does not have any uniqueness constraints, you may want the label property or the title property.
  If the property you are defining does not have any character constraints, you may want the title property.
