  Name is one of the more subtle concepts. Names are different from labels and titles because there is an expectation that a resource may be referenced using its name. When people
  reference a resource by name, they must understand that the reference is only valid at a particular point in time
  and in a particular context. Outside of that specific time and context a reference by name may fail, or
  may cause mistaken identity. By contrast, a reference by id (preferebly the self pointer) is guaranteed for all time and contexts.

  Names generally have the following properties:
  * They can be changed - they are not immutable
  * They may be unique within some scope. For example, files within a folder, or departments within a company cannot have the same name
  * There may be some restrictions on characters. For example, whitespace may be forbidden
  * It may permissible for a resource to have more than one name at a time

  If the property you are defining is immutable, you may want the identity (id) property or the self property, not the name property.
  If the property you are defining does not have any uniqueness constraints, you may want the label property or the title property.
  If the property you are defining does not have any character constraints, you may want the title property.
