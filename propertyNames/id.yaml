  An id, or identity, has the following characteristics:

  * It is immutable
  * It is unique. The simplest ids are globally unique â€” no two entities can ever have the same ID. It is also possible to have ids that are unique within a scope, but only if that scope is immutable. For example, ID may be unique within entities of the same type, provided the type of an entity cannot change. In effect, it is the combination of type and id value that form the globally-unique id
  * It is unique over time. That is, there is no sequence of changes (e.g. delete and create) that could cause a different entity to acquire the id previously associated with a different entity 

  In general, we prefer the use of the self property to the id property. The self property is an ID property whose value is a URL/URI. ID is used
  for non-URL identity values, which are genenrally less useful. Consider using self instead of id.
