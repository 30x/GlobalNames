  Every resource that is governed by the permissions service has an implicit relationship
  to its permissions. Some resources express this relationship explicitly by including
  a '_permissions' property in the representation of the resource. APIs implemented by the
  permissions service that include properties of the goverened resource may add this
  property, even if the underlying resource implementation does not provide it.
