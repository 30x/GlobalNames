  Each resource that is governed by he permissions service may have 'permissions heirs'.
  Permissions heirs are resources that inherit permissions from another resource.
  '_permissionsHeirs' is thus an implicit relationship of every resource governed by the 
  permissions service. Some resources make this relationship explicit by including a 
  _permissionsHeirs property in their representation.
